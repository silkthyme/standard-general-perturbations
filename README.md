# standard-general-perturbations
This goal of this project is to generate a python script that takes in a NORAD standard TLE, and generates what the TLE is going to be after various numbers of minutes. It will eventually be used in tracking the location of the CUBESAT to be launched by UC Davis in 2022.

This project is currently a command line app, so to run this script locally, you will need to have Python3 installed and some way to run python script. Run the script, and input a NORAD standard TLE (examples can be found on our wiki). If you have a mac, control+d will run the script. With a windows, it's control+z+enter.

This project was created and is currently maintained by the Orbital Propogation Team of the Space and Satelite Society at the University of California at Davis.
